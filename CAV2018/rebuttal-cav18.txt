(R1) Why not use existent control techniques such as those described in [3]?

(R2) Why is the CEGIS approach different from the one in Aabate's CAV'17 paper? In particular, abstraction refinement is used in both cases.

(R2) How does the optimization step compare to Raman et al. "Reactive synthesis from signal temporal logic specifications", HSCC'15?

(R2) How much harder is to synthesise a controller+observer, compared to just a controller? What are the timings when trying to solve the current problem with the techniques in Aabate's CAV'17?

(R3) Why use a SAT solver and not a numerical solver given that you are discovering matrices and that you have an optimization criterion? What solver was used for the optimization step?

(R4) You mention in the Abstract step that some of the constraints will be used by the SYNTHESIZE phase to reduce the size of the solution space. How is that done? Is it just by incorporating the constraints into the solver, or is the size reduced in a more explicit way?
