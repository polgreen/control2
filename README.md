## DSSynth Toolbox

DSSynth is a MATLAB Toolbox that synthesizes digital controllers considering FWL (finite word-length) effects, given a digital plant (in transfer-function or state-space format) with numerical representation (fixed-point representation) and dynamic input ranges. Currently, there are a two versions: command-line and MATLAB application.

#### Prerequisistes:

In order to execute DSSynth in MATLAB, the user must install the DSSynth Toolbox in MATLAB 2016b Linux version.

Required tools to run the scripts: Linux/MATLAB;
MATLAB version: at least version 2016b;

#### Installation:

In order to install DSSynth Toolbox , the user must download the DSSynth Toolbox installation file from .
After that, the following steps must be executed:

1. Open MATLAB;
2. Execute the file with the “$.mltbx$” extension (or double-click on it); a pop-up screen to install DSSynth Toolbox will be shown.
3. Click on the install button.

#### Automated Procedures Performed by MATLAB:

1. Setup: get the plant, fixed-point format and dynamic input ranges, and then translate it to a struct in MATLAB;
2. Parse: get the digital plant implementation, and then translate to a ANSI-C file;
3. Execute: get the ANSI-C file, call CBMC as back-end program synthesis tool, and then perform the synthesis;
4. Extract: get the .log generated after the synthesization and check the digital-controller synthesized.
5. Report: get the digital-controller, translate it to a MATLAB system, and then show the result to the user.

## Toolbox Command-Line Usage:

Steps to use the toolbox:

1) Download and Install MATLAB 2016b;
2) Download and Install the DSSynth Toolbox;
3) Design a digital-plant into MATLAB as transfer-function or state-space format;
4) Start the synthesis process providing all required parameters (plant, numeric representation, dynamic ranges).

# Invoking Command:

synthesize(plant,intBits,fracBits, maxRange, minRange)

- plant: digital-plant as transfer-function or state-space. See details about 'tf' and 'ss' commands in MATLAB to design digital-systems.
- intBits: represents the integer bits part;
- fracBits: represents the fractionary bits part;
- rangeMax: represents the maximum dynamical range;
- rangeMin: represents the minimum dynamical range;

## Toolbox Application Usage:

In order to favor the synthesis of digital-controllers, a MATLAB Application was developed for DSSynth, which aims to improve usability and, consequently, attract more digital-system engineers (potential users). In Addition, the MATLAB Application is able to generate graphs as Step Response in order to show the stability of digital-controller generated by DSSynth.
