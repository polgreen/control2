\section{Introduction}
Modern implementations of embedded control systems have proliferated with
the availability of low-cost devices that can perform highly non-trivial
control tasks, with significant impact in numerous application areas such as
life sciences, environmental control and robotics~\cite{astrom1997computer, Franklin15}. 
Correct synthesis is non-trivial, even in cases with restriceted dynamics.
We examine the case of Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Models, for which the
synthesis of controllers is well understood. However, the
use of digital control architectures adds new challenges caused by artifacts
specific to digital control, such as the effects of finite-precision arithmetic, time
discretization and quantization noise introduced by A/D and D/A conversion.

While research on digital control is well developed~\cite{astrom1997computer},
automated and sound control synthesis is challenging, particularly when the
synthesis objective goes beyond classical stability.  There are recent methods
for verifying reachability properties of a given controller~\cite{FLD+11}.
However, these methods have not been generalized to control synthesis.  
Note that a synthesis algorithm that guarantees stability does not
ensure safety: the system might transitively visit an unsafe state resulting
in unrecoverable failure. Programming expertise is a key
barrier to broad adoption of correct digital controllers, and requires
considerable knowledge outside of the expertise of many control engineers.

Beyond classical a-posteriori validation in digital control, there has been
plenty of previous work aiming at \emph{verifying} a given designed
controller, which however broadly lack automation.  Recent work has studied
the stability of digital controllers considering implementation aspects,
i.e., fixed-point arithmetic and the word length~\cite{Bessa16}.  They
exploit advances in bit-accurate verification of C programs to obtain a
verifier for software-implemented digital control.

By contrast, we leverage a very recent step-change in the automation and
scalability of \emph{program synthesis}.  Program synthesis engines use a
specification as the starting point, and subsequently generate a sequence of
candidate programs from a given template.  The candidate programs are
iteratively refined to eventually satisfy the specification.  Program
synthesizers implementing Counter-Example Guided Inductive Synthesis
(CEGIS)~\cite{DBLP:conf/asplos/Solar-LezamaTBSS06} are now able to generate
programs for highly non-trivial specifications with a very high degree of
automation.  Modern synthesis engines combine automated testing, genetic
algorithms, and SMT-based automated
reasoning~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/AlurFSS16a, DBLP:conf/lpar/DavidKL15}.

By combining state-of-the-art synthesis engines we present a tool that
automatically generates digital controllers for a given continuous plant
model that are correct by construction.  This approach delivers a high
degree of automation, promises to reduce the cost and time of development of
digital control dramatically, and requires considerably less expertise than
a-posteriori verification.  Specifically, we synthesize stable,
software-implemented embedded controllers along with a model of a physical
plant.  Due to the complexity of such closed-loop systems, in this work we
focus on linear models with known configurations, and perform parametric
synthesis of stabilizing digital controllers with a number of properties that
define their desired behaviour.

Our work addresses challenging aspects of the control synthesis problem.
We perform digital control synthesis over a hybrid model, where the plant
exhibits continuous behavior whereas the controller operates in discrete
time and over a quantized domain. In particular, our model evaluates the
effects of the quantizers (A/D and D/A converters) and of time discretization,
as well as representation errors introduced by in modelling artifacts
such as an observer~\cite{astrom1997computer} in a finite precision domain, 
while reasoning about high level properties such as stability, robustness, safety,
and response time, which define the behaviour of the system. In particular,
safety requirements are frequently overlooked in conventional feedback control
synthesis, but play an important role in systems engineering.

Using state of the art verifiers, we evaluate these models against automatically 
synthesised controllers using CEGIS-based synsthesis that incorporate the above
mentioned artifacts in different models of Single-Input/Single-Output (SISO) systems.
We offer three modes of operation that address different aspects of the problem.

{\em The first  approach} uses a transfer-function based analysis that solves the
problem of robust stability for closed loop systems for a collection of unstable plants.
Inthis case, there is no safety specification since we are working in the frequency domain.

{\em The second approach} uses a na\"ive technique that starts by devising a
digital controller that stabilizes the system while remaining safe for a
pre-selected time horizon and a single initial state; then, it verifies
unbounded safety by unfolding the dynamics of the system, considering the
full hyper-cube of initial states, and checking a {\em completeness
threshold}~\cite{DBLP:conf/vmcai/KroeningS03}, i.e., the number of
iterations required to sufficiently unwind the closed-loop state-space
system such that the boundaries are not violated for any larger number of
iterations.  As~it requires unfolding up to the completeness threshold, this
approach is computationally expensive.

Instead of unfolding the dynamics, {\em the third approach}
employs {\em abstract acceleration}~\cite{cattaruzza2015unbounded} to
evaluate all possible progressions of the system simultaneously. 
Additionally, this approach uses {\em abstraction refinement},
enabling us to always start with a very simple description regardless of the
dynamics complexity, and only expand to more complex models
when a solution cannot be found.

We provide experimental results showing that all our approaches are able to
efficiently synthesize safe controllers for a set of intricate
physical plant models taken from the digital control literature.

In summary, this paper makes the following original contributions.
%
\begin{enumerate}

\item We automatically generate {\em correct-by-construction} digital
  controllers using an inductive synthesis approach.  Our application of program
  synthesis is non-trivial and addresses challenges specific to control
  systems, such as quantizers and FWL.  In particular, we
  have found that a two-stage verification engine that continuously refines
  the precision of the fixed-point representation of the plant yields a
  speed-up of two orders of magnitude over a conventional one-stage
  verification engine.

%
\item  We compute state-feedback controllers that 
  guarantee a given safety property alongside stability and response time
  specifications.  Existing methods for controller synthesis rely on transfer
  function representations, which are inadequate to prove safety requirements.
%
\item We provide three novel algorithms: the first, na\"ive one, relies on
  an unfolding of the dynamics up to a completeness threshold, while the
  second one is abstraction-based and leverages abstraction refinement and
  acceleration to improve scalability while retaining soundness.  A third algorithm
  evaluates systems using transfer functions where no state-space description is given.
  All three approaches provide sound synthesis of feedback controllers and consider
  the various sources of imprecision in the implementation of the control
  algorithm and in the modeling of the plant.
%
\item We develop a model for different sources of quantization error and
  their effect on reachability properties.  We give bounds that ensure the
  safety of our controllers in a hybrid continuous-digital domain.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relw}
%-------------------------------

\textbf{CEGIS -}
Program synthesis is the problem of computing correct-by-design programs
from high-level specifications. Algorithms for this problem have made
substantial progress in recent years, for instance~\cite{itzhaky2010simple} 
to inductively synthesize invariants for the generation of desired programs.

Program synthesizers are an ideal fit for the synthesis of digital controllers, since
the semantics of programs capture the effects of finite-precision arithmetic
precisely.  In~\cite{DBLP:conf/cdc/RavanbakhshS15}, the authors use CEGIS
for the synthesis of switching controllers for stabilizing continuous-time
plants with polynomial dynamics.  The work extends to affine systems, but is
limited by the capacity of the state-of-the-art SMT solvers for solving
linear arithmetic.  Since this approach uses switching models instead of
linear dynamics for the digital controller, it avoids problems related to
finite precision arithmetic, but potentially suffers from state-space
explosion.  Moreover, in \cite{DBLP:conf/emsoft/RavanbakhshS16} the same
authors use a CEGIS-based approach for synthesizing continuous-time
switching controllers that guarantee \emph{reach-while-stay} properties of
closed-loop systems, i.e., properties that specify a set of goal states and
safe states (constrained reachability).  This solution is based on
synthesizing control Lyapunov functions for switched systems that yield
switching controllers with a guaranteed minimum dwell time in each mode. 
However, both approaches are unsuitable for the kind of control we seek to
synthesize.

The work in~\cite{hscc-paper} synthesizes stabilizing
controllers for continuous plants given as transfer functions by exploiting
bit-accurate verification of software-implemented digital
controllers~\cite{Bessa16}.  While this work also uses CEGIS,
the approach is restricted to digital controllers for stable closed-loop
systems given as transfer function models: 
this results in  a static check on their coefficients.  
By contrast, in the current paper we consider a state-space representation of the physical system, 
which requires ensuring the specification over actual traces of the model, 
alongside the numerical soundness required by the effects of discretisation and finite-precision errors.   
A state-space model has known advantages over the transfer function
representation~\cite{Franklin15}: it naturally generalizes to multivariate systems
(i.e., with multiple inputs and outputs); 
and it allows synthesis of control systems with guarantees on the internal dynamics, e.g.,
to synthesize controllers that make the closed-loop system \emph{safe}.  Our
work focuses on the \emph{safety} of internal states, which is usually
overlooked in the literature.  Moreover, our work integrates an
abstraction/refinement (CEGAR) step inside the main CEGIS loop.

The tool Pessoa~\cite{mazo2010pessoa} synthesizes correct-by-design embedded
control software in a Matlab toolbox.  It is based on the abstraction of a
physical system to an equivalent finite-state machine and on the computation
of reachability properties thereon. 
Based on this safety specification, \mbox{Pessoa} can synthesize embedded controller
software for a range of properties.  The embedded controller software can be
more complicated than the state-feedback control we synthesize, and the
properties available cover more detail. 
However, relying on state-space discretization \mbox{Pessoa} is likely to incur in scalability limitations. 
Along this research line, \cite{Anta2010,liu16} studies the synthesis of digital controllers for continuous dynamics, 
and \cite{zamani2014} extends the approach to the recent setup of Network Control Systems. 

\textbf{Discretization Effects -}
The classical approach to control synthesis has often disregarded digitalization effects, 
whereas more recently modern techniques have focused on
different aspects of discretization, including delayed
response~\cite{Duggirala2015} and finite word length (FWL) semantics, 
with the goal either to verify (e.g.,~\cite{daes20161}) or to optimize
(e.g.,~\cite{oudjida2014design}) given implementations. 

There are two different problems that arise from FWL semantics.  The first
is the error in the dynamics caused by the inability to represent the exact
state of the physical system, while the second relates to rounding and saturation errors
during computation.  In~\cite{fialho1994stability}, a stability measure
based on the error of the digital dynamics ensures that the deviation
introduced by FWL does not make the digital system unstable.  A~more recent
approach~\cite{DBLP:journals/automatica/WuLCC09} uses $\mu$-calculus to
directly model the digital controller so that the selected parameters are
stable by design.  The analyses in~\cite{DBLP:conf/hybrid/RouxJG15,
DBLP:conf/hybrid/WangGRJF16} rely on an invariant computation on the
discrete system dynamics using Semi-Definite Programming (SDP).  While the
former uses bounded-input and bounded-output (BIBO) properties to determine
stability, the latter uses Lyapunov-based quadratic invariants.  In both
cases, the SDP solver uses floating-point arithmetic and soundness is
checked by bounding the error.  An alternative is~\cite{park2016scalable},
where the verification of given control code is performed against a known
model by extracting an LTI model of the code by symbolic execution:  
to account for rounding errors, an upper bound is introduced in the
verification phase.  The work in \cite{picasso2003stabilization}
introduces invariant sets as a mechanism
to bound the quantization error effect on stabilization as an invariant set
that always converges toward the controllable set.  Similarly,
\cite{liberzon2003hybrid} evaluates the quantization error dynamics
and bounds its trajectory to a known region over a finite time period. 
This technique works for both linear and non-linear systems.

\textcolor{red}{Elizabeth: we need to define the notation used throughout the paper.}

\subsection{Abstract Acceleration} 
\label{ssec:aa}
%-------------------------------
For abstraction based synthesis, we will use Abstract Acceleration~\cite{JSS14,cattaruzza2015unbounded}.
Given an iterative program with dynamics
\begin{equation}
\vec{x}_{k+1}=\mat{A}\vec{x}_k : \vec{x}_k \in \mathbb{R}^n \wedge \mat{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \wedge k \in [0\ \ \infty),
\end{equation}
we want to find all possible states visited over an infinite time horizon starting at an initial set $X_0$. We call this set the \emph{reach tube} of the model:
\begin{equation}
\hat{X} = \{ \vec{x}_k : k \in [0\ \infty) \wedge \vec{x}_0 \in X_0 \wedge \vec{x}_{k+1}=\mat{A}\vec{x}_k\}.
\end{equation}
It is easy to see that the infinite number of iterations would result in an unbounded cumulative rounding error, but using Abstract Acceleration we transform this problem into a one-step solution.
We first change the problem statement by means of acceleration into 
\begin{equation}
\hat{X} = \{ \vec{x}_k=\mat{A}^k\vec{x}_0 : k \in [0\ \infty) \wedge \vec{x}_0 \in X_0 \}, 
\end{equation}
and further define new model semantics and corresponding set: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:aa_reachtube}
\hat{X} \subseteq \hat{X}^\sharp = \mathcal{A}X_0, \text{ such that } \bigcup_{k \in [0\ \infty)} \mat{A}^k \subseteq \mathcal{A}, 
\end{equation}
where the newly introduced \emph{abstract reach tube} $\hat{X}^\sharp$ is an over-approximation of the reach tube of the model \cite{JSS14}.
All we need to do is define the nature of $\mathcal{A}X_0$. 

Let $\mat{S}\mat{J}\mat{S}^{-1}=\mat{A}$ be the eigen-decomposition of
$\mat{A}$, where $\mat{S}$ is the set of generalised eigenvectors of
$\mat{A}$ and $\mat{J}$ is the Jordan Form containing the eigenvalues of
$\mat{A}$ in its main diagonal.  We correspondingly define
$\mathcal{J}=\mat{S}^{-1}\mathcal{A}\mat{S}$, which is such that $\mathcal{J} \supseteq \bigcup_{k \in [0\
\infty)} \mat{J}^k$.

Introduce set $X=\{ \vec{x} : \mat{C}\vec{x} \leq \vec{d}\}$. 
The linear transformation $\vec{x}'=\mat{S}^{-1}\vec{x}$ leads to set 
\begin{equation}
X'= \mat{S}^{-1}X = \{\vec{x}' : \mat{C}\mat{S}\vec{x}'\leq \vec{d}\}.  
\label{eq:eigenInit}
\end{equation}
Analogously, 
let $X_0'=\mat{S}^{-1}X_0$ and ${\hat{X}'^\sharp}=\mat{S}^{-1}{\hat{X}^\sharp}$ be the initial set and the abstract reach tube mapped onto the eigenspace of matrix $\mat{A}$. 
We may transform equation \eqref{eq:aa_reachtube} into:
\begin{equation}
\hat{X}' \subseteq {\hat{X}'^\sharp} = \mathcal{J}X_0', \text{ such that } \bigcup_{k \in [0\ \ \infty)}\mat{J}^k \subseteq \mathcal{J}, 
\end{equation}
where $\hat{X}'=\mat{S}^{-1}\hat{X}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ is a convex polyhedron representing restrictions on the eigenvalues of $\mat{A}$.
$\hat{X}'^\sharp$ is calculated by applying a simplex algorithm with a tableau defined by $\mathcal{J}$ and objective functions derived from each vertex of $X_0'$ (step \eqref{alg:getReachTube} in Algorithm \ref{alg:findReachTube} below).
We note, however, that if we wish to use numerical analysis in the decomposition of $\mat{A}$, 
the Tableau in $\mathcal{J}$ contains small intervals given by the errors, which cannot be processed efficiently by a regular simplex and require a new procedure. 

The calculation of the abstract reach tube via abstract acceleration is encompassed in Algorithm \ref{alg:findReachTube}, 
which can be summarised as follows (its steps are denoted in parentheses):
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item We perform unsound eigen-decomposition using an existing algebra package (lines \ref{alg:calcEigenvalues}-\ref{alg:calcEigenvectors}).
\item Then we restore soundness to the results using the methods described in Section \ref{sec:eigensolver} (lines \ref{alg:soundEigenvalues}-\ref{alg:soundEigenvectors}). 
\item The inverse of the matrix of eigenvectors is calculated after soundness is restored, using interval arithmetic in order to ensure its soundness (line \ref{alg:inverse}).
\item The abstract dynamics are obtained by evaluating the convex hull of all powers of eigenvalues up to the desired number of iterations as described in \cite{cattaruzza2015unbounded} (line \ref{alg:aa}).
\item Using Equation \eqref{eq:eigenInit}, transform the initial state into the eigenspace (line \ref{alg:eigeninit}).
\item Extract the vertices of the eigen-polyhedron $X_0'$ using the sound over-approximation of the double description algorithm \cite{fukuda1996double} from Section \ref{sec:dd} (line \ref{alg:getVertices}). It is worth noting that this algorithm uses a simplex to seed it: we will first discuss the simplex algorithm, which is also needed at the next step, and then the vertex enumeration algorithm used at this stage. 
\item Calculate the mapped \emph{abstract reach tube} ${\hat{X}'^\sharp}$ that over-approximates the image of the reach tube in the eigenspace (line \ref{alg:getReachTube}). This is achieved by evaluating a set of objective functions using the abstract dynamics as a simplex Tableau, 
and via a sound simplex described in Section \ref{sec:simplex}. 
The objective functions are defined by the vertices of $X'_0$, 
denote as $V_0$, 
and by the desired template directions, 
such that 
\begin{equation*}
\vec{w}_{ij}= \vec{v}_i \circ \vec{t}_j : \vec{v}_i \in V_0 \wedge \vec{t}_j \in T,
\end{equation*}
where $T$ is the set of template directions, and $\circ$ denotes a component-wise multiplication yielding a vector. 
\item Using Equation \eqref{eq:eigenInit}, find the reach tube $\hat{X}^\sharp=\mat{S}{\hat{X}'^\sharp}$ (line \ref{alg:getNormReachTube}).

 \subsection{Overapproximating continuous time dynamics using discrete models}
 \label{sec:cont_aa}
%-------------------------------
Thus far we wave discussed the Abstract Accelertion of Discrete Time systems. However, our plant models derive
from the discretization of continuous time systems. We therefore seek to establish a sound
overapproximation which does not only encompass the selected discretization, but any chosen discretization in the 
time domain.

A dynamical system is a system in which a function describes the progression of a state over time. 
In a continuous domain with linear dynamics, it is described by a first order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE).
\begin{equation}
\dot{x}(t)=\mat{A}_o\vec{x}(t)+\mat{B}_o\vec{u}(t) +\vec{w}(t)
\label{eq:dynamical}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{w}$  is a continuous zero-mean white noise source with covariance $N ( 0 , Q )$
Furthermore, a control system may have a derived output that is a linear combination of its states and inputs, 
which may restricts the observability of the statespace from the output space.
\begin{equation}
\vec{y}(t)=\mat{C}_o\vec{x}(t)+\mat{D}_o\vec{u}(t)
\end{equation}
Discretization of a continuous dynamical system turns the ODE into a difference equation, assuming zero-order hold
for the input $\vec{u}$ and continuous integration for the noise $\vec{w}$, to
\begin{align}
\label{eq:discretization}
\vec{x}_{k+1} &= \mat{A}_d\vec{x}_k+\mat{B}_d\vec{u}_k + \vec{w}_k\\
y_k &= \mat{C}_d \vec{x}_ k + \mat{D}_d \vec{u}_ k 
\end{align}
with covariance for $\vec{w}_k$, $N ( 0 , Q_d )$
where
\begin{align}
\label{eq:discretize}
\mat{A}_d &= e^{\mat{A}_o T_s} = \mathcal{L}^{-1} { ( s \mat{I} - \mat{A}_o )^{-1} }_{t = T_s}\\
\mat{B}_d &= \int_{t = 0}^{T_s} e^{\mat{A}_o t} dt\ \mat{B}_o = \mat{A}_o^{-1} ( \mat{A}_d - \mat{I} ) \mat{B}_o\\
\mat{C}_d &= \mat{C}_o\\
\mat{D}_d &= \mat{D}_o \\
Q_d &= \int_{t = 0}^{T_s} e^{\mat{A}_o t} Q e^{\mat{A}_o^T t} dt
\end{align}
and $T_s$ is the sample time. Then
\begin{align*}
x(kT)=x_k \wedge y(kT) = y_k, \forall k
\end{align*}

 \label{sec:real_aa}
%-------------------------------

 \begin{theorem}
 The expression
 \begin{align}
 \vec{x}_T&=\vec{x}(t=T)=\mat{A}_{T}\vec{x}_0 : \dot{\vec{x}}=\mat{A}\vec{x} \wedge \mat{A}=\mat{S}\mat{J}\mat{S}^{-1}\nonumber\\
 \mat{A}_{T}&= \mat{S}
 \left [ \begin{array}{cccc}
 e^{T\lambda_i}  & s_i\frac{T^{j-i}e^{T\lambda_i}}{(j-i)!} & \hdots  & s_i\frac{T^{p-i}e^{T\lambda_i}}{(p-i)!} \\
0 & e^{T\lambda_i}  & s_i\frac{T^{j-i}e^{T\lambda_i}}{(j-i)!} & \vdots \\
\vdots & & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & \cdots & 0  &e^{T\lambda_i} \\
\end{array} \right ]
 \mat{S}^{-1}\nonumber\\
 s_i&=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}1&gm(\lambda_i)>1\\0&gm(\lambda_i)=1\end{array}\right.
 \label{eq:continuous_tube_dyn}
 \end{align}
 where $\lambda_i \in \mat{J}$ are the eigenvalues of $\mat{A}$, and $gm(\lambda_i)$ is the geometric multiplicity of $\lambda_i$ is a witness of the system $\dot{\vec{x}}(t)=\mat{A}\vec{x}$ at time t=T.
 \end{theorem}
 \begin{corollary}
 If $\mat{J}$ is diagonal and there exists a discrete dynamics matrix for a sampling time $T_d :  A_d=e^{\mat{A} T_d}$, then $\vec{x}_k=A_d^k\vec{x} : k \in (0,\infty)$ is a witness of the system at time $t=kT_d$.
 \end{corollary}
 \begin{proof}
 Let us recall equation \ref{eq:discretize}. The discrete representation of the system dynamics discretized with sample time $T_1$ is ruled by the formula
 $\mat{A}_1 = e^{\mat{A} T_1}$. From matrix theory, we have 
\begin{align}
 e^{\mat{A}}&=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}\mat{A}^k
\end{align} 
\begin{align} 
 e^{\mat{S}\mat{J}\mat{S}^{-1}}&=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}(\mat{S}\mat{J}\mat{S}^{-1})^k
 =\mat{S} \left (\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}\mat{J}^k\right) \mat{S}^{-1}
 =\mat{S}e^{\mat{J}}\mat{S}^{-1}
\end{align} 
\begin{equation}
\mat{A}=\mat{S}\mat{J}\mat{S}^{-1} \Rightarrow \vec{A}_1 = \mat{S}\mat{J}_1\mat{S}^{-1}= \mat{S}e^{\mat{J} T_1}\mat{S}^{-1}.
 \end{equation}
 
 Let $\mat{J}$ be a diagonal matrix, such that 
 $${\lambda_1}_i=e^{\lambda_i T_1}, \forall \lambda_i \in \mat{J}.$$
 Let us now take a different sample rate $T_2$, such that 
 $${\lambda_2}_i=e^{\lambda_i T_2}, \forall \lambda_i \in \mat{J}.$$
 We can then say that 
 \begin{equation}
 {\lambda_2}_i=e^{\lambda_i T_1 \frac{T_2}{T_1}}={\lambda_1}_i^{\frac{T_2}{T_1}} \Rightarrow A_2=A_1^{\frac{T_2}{T_1}}.
 \end{equation}
 This proves the theorem for $gm(\lambda_i)=1$.
 We now note that given an exponentiated Jordan form with geometric multiplicity, the upper diagonal terms can be
 referenced to the original eigenvalues modified by the sampling rate.
  Let $\mat{J}\in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$ be a Jordan Canonical matrix. Then
\begin{align}
 \mat{J}_1=&\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}\left(\mat{J}T_1\right)^k\nonumber\\
 =&\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} \left [ \begin{array}{cccc}
 \lambda_i^k  & \binom{k}{1}  \lambda^{k-1} & \hdots  & \binom{k}{p-1} \lambda_i^{k-p+1} \\
& \lambda_i^k  & \binom{k}{1}  \lambda_i^{k-1} & \vdots \\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
& &  &\lambda_i^k \\
\end{array} \right ] T_1^k
\end{align}
The eigenvalues remain the same as in the diagonal case, but the upper triangular terms are of the form:
\begin{align}
\forall j>i, c_{ij}&=\sum_{k=j-i}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}\binom{k}{j-i} \lambda_i^{k-(j-i)}T_1^k\\
&=\frac{1}{(j-i)!}\sum_{k=j-i}^\infty \frac{1}{(k-(j-i))!} \lambda_i^{k-(j-i)}T_1^k\nonumber\\
&=\frac{T_1^{j-i}e^{\lambda_i T_1}}{(j-i)!}\nonumber
\end{align}
which completes the proof for $gm(\lambda_i)>1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
The expression
 \begin{align}
 \vec{x}_T&=\vec{x}(t=T)=\mat{A}^{-1}\vec{x}_T'\nonumber\\
\vec{x}_T'&=\mat{A}\mat{A}_T\vec{x}_0 + (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_T)\mat{B}\vec{u} : \forall t \leq T,\ \vec{u}(t)=\vec{u} 
 \end{align}
 with $\mat{A}_T$ as per \eqref{eq:continuous_tube_dyn} is a witness of the system $\dot{\vec{x}}(t)=\mat{A}\vec{x}(t)+\mat{B}\vec{u}(t)$ at time $T$ given a parametric input $\vec{u}$.
 \end{theorem}
 \begin{corollary}
 If $\mat{J}$ is diagonal and there exists a discrete dynamics matrix for a sampling time $T_d :  A_d=e^{\mat{A} T_d}$, then $\vec{x}_k=A_d^k\vec{x}+(\mat{I}-\mat{A}_d^k\mat{B}\vec{u}) : k \in (0,\infty)$ is a witness of the system at time $kT_d$.
 \end{corollary}
 \begin{proof}
 We begin by expanding the equation
 \begin{align}
 \vec{x}_T&=\mat{A}^{-1}\vec{x}_T'\\
 \vec{x}_T'&=\mat{A}_T\vec{x}_0 + \mat{A}^{-1}(\mat{I}-\mat{A}_T)\mat{B}\vec{u} = \mat{A}_T\vec{x}_0 + \mat{B}_T\vec{u}\nonumber
 \end{align}
 where $\mat{A}_T=e^{\mat{A}T}$ and $\mat{B}_T=\mat{A}^{-1}(\mat{I}-\mat{A}_T)\mat{B}$ correspond to $\mat{A}_d$ and $\mat{B}_d$ in equation \eqref{eq:discretize}
 \end{proof}
 \begin{theorem}
Let $\mat{A}_b$ be a spherical overapproximation of $\mat{A}$ and $U_b$ a spherical overapproximation of $U$ centered at $\vec{u}_c$
\begin{align}
\mat{A}_b&=\mat{S} \mat{J}_b \mat{S}^{-1}\\
\mat{J}_{bs}&=\lambda_{bs}\mat{I} \wedge \lambda_{bs}=|| \mat{J}_s ||=
\max_{\vec{u} \subseteq U_b'} \frac{|| \mat{J}_s\vec{u}_s ||}{||
  \vec{u}_s ||}\nonumber
\label{eq:induced}
\end{align}
where $|| \mat{J}_s ||$ is the induced matrix norm, $s$ indicates the index of each Jordan block, and $\vec{u}_s$ is the corresponding subvector of $\vec{u}$ (\emph{ie} the subspace of $\vec{u}$ on which $\mat{J}_s$ operates).
Directly from the definition of the matrix norm, we have 
\begin{equation}
||\mat{J}_s\vec{u}_s|| \leq ||\mat{J}_s||\,||\vec{u}_s||, 
\label{eq:overinduced}
\end{equation}
and $\mat{J}_{b} U_b$ is the smallest ball that over-approximates $\mat{J}  U_d$.

The expression
 \begin{align}
X_T^\sharp &=\mat{A}^{-1}X_T'\supseteq X_T\\
X_T'&=\mat{A}\mat{A}_TX_0 \oplus (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_{bT})\mat{B}U_b \oplus (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_T)\mat{B}\vec{u}_c\nonumber
 \end{align}
 is an overapproximation of the reach set  at time $t=T$ of the system $\dot{\vec{x}}(t)=\mat{A}\vec{x}(t) + \mat{B}\vec{u}(t)$ given $\vec{x}(0) \in X_0$ and $\vec{u}(t) \in U$.
 \end{theorem}
\begin{corollary}
 If $\mat{J}$ is diagonal and there exists a discrete dynamics matrix for a sampling time $T_d :  A_d=e^{\mat{A} T_d}$, then 
 \begin{equation}
 \tiny
 X_k=A_d^kX_0 \oplus (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_{bd}^k)(\mat{I}-\mat{A}_{bd})^{-1}\mat{B}U_b \oplus (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_d^k)(\mat{I}-\mat{A}_d)^{-1}\mat{B}\vec{u}_c\nonumber\\
 k \in (0,\infty)
 \end{equation}
  is a witness of the system at time $kT_d$, where $\mat{A}_{bd}$ is a spherical overapproximation of $\mat{A}_d$
\end{corollary}
 \begin{proof}
Let $U'=\mat{B}U$, with $\vec{u}'$ its geometrical centre and $U_b'$ the smallest sphere centered at $\vec{u}'$ containing all points in $U'$.
Then $U'\subseteq U_b' \oplus \vec{u}_c' \Rightarrow (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_T)U' \subseteq (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_T)U_b' \oplus (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_T)\vec{u}_c'$. Since $ (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_{bT})U_b'\supseteq  (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_T)U_b'$, then $(\mat{I}-\mat{A}_T)U' \subseteq (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_{bT})U_b' \oplus (\mat{I}-\mat{A}_T)\vec{u}_c'$ thus proving the theorem.
  
\end{proof}

 \subsubsection{Finding Abstract Supports for Continuous Dynamics}
 \label{sec:cont_aasup}
%-------------------------------

In the case of Discrete dynamics, support functions can be found by evaluating hyperplanes of consecutive exponents of the eigenvalues using differences.
In the case of continuous time, this translates to calculating derivatives. Once again, when the sets are known to be convex,
we may calculate the normal vector to this derivative and evaluate its support function on the selected iteration. The direction of the vector is determined by evaluating the support function of another point in the curve, which is known to be smaller than that of the selected point.
The corresponding derivatives are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item for real eigenvalues: we first calculate the slope of the tangent between the two progressions: $\frac{d f(k)}{d g(k)}=\frac{f'(k)}{g'(k)}$. Hence $\frac{d \lambda_1^k}{d \lambda_2^k}=\frac{log(\lambda_1) \lambda_1^k}{log(\lambda_2) \lambda_2^k}$. From this we know that the polar angle of the support vector is $\psi = \tan^{-1}(\frac{log(\lambda_1) \lambda_1^k}{log(\lambda_2) \lambda_2^k})+\frac{\pi}{2}$
\item for conjugate eigenvalue pairs: the pair forms a logarithmic spiral. The tangent of a spiral with polar equation $r=a e^{b\theta}$ will have a derivative $\frac{d r}{d \theta}=b a e^{b\theta}=b r$, hence the angle of the vector normal to the curve is $\tan^{-1}(\frac{r}{\frac{d r}{d \theta}})+\frac{\pi}{2}=\tan^{-1}(\frac{1}{b})+\frac{\pi}{2}$
\item for Jordan blocks with $gm>1$: in the case of real eigenvalues, we follow the same procedure as in the real case, but considering that the equation for each eigenvalue is $\frac{k^j}{j!}e^{\lambda k}$ where $j$ is the index of the term within the Jordan block (note that when $j=0$ the term is the same as for real eigenvalues above). The derivatives f'(k),g'(k) are in the form $(j+k*log(\lambda))\frac{k^{j-1}}{j!}e^{\lambda k}$.
\item for any combination of complex eigenvalues we use the above equations using the envelope of their magnitude (ie $|\lambda|$).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Counterexample Guided Inductive Synthesis} 
\label{ssec:cegis}
%-------------------------------

In order to synthesize closed-loop digital control systems, we use a program
synthesis engine.  Our program synthesizer implements Counter-Example Guided
Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS)~\cite{DBLP:conf/asplos/Solar-LezamaTBSS06}.  We
start by presenting its general architecture followed by describing the
parts specific to closed-loop control systems.  A high-level view of the
synthesis process is given in Figure~\ref{DSSynth_process}.  Steps $1$ to
$3$ are performed by the user and Steps~A to D are automatically performed
by our tool for Digital Systems Synthesis, named \tool.

CEGIS-based control synthesis requires a formal verifier to check whether a
candidate controller meets the requirements when combined with the plant. 
We use the Digital-System Verifier (DSVerifier)~\cite{IsmailBCFF15} in the
verification module for \tool.  It checks the stability of closed-loop control systems and
considers finite-word length (FWL) effects in the digital controller and
uncertainty parameters in the plant model (plant intervals)~\cite{Bessa16}.   

%
%, which accepts the
%digital controller transfer functions together with the plant model.  For
%any digital controller, implementation details should be provided ({\it
%e.g.}, number of bits, realization, and sample time).

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/synthesis-flow.pdf}
\vspace{0.1cm}
\caption{Overview of the synthesis process\label{DSSynth_process}}
\end{figure}

%In Step $1$, the user provides inputs $G(z)$ and $\Delta{G}(z)$
%%$\%$ ({\it i.e.}, $\Delta{G}(z)$ as a percentage of $G(z)$)
%, which contain the plant model and the
%interval, respectively.  In Step $2$, a digital controller must be designed
%with any preferred method, where $C(z)$ is obtained.  The controller
%numerical representation and realization form are chosen in Steps $3$ and
%$4$, respectively.  In Step $5$, the user finally configures the
%verification parameters ({\it e.g.}, verification time, properties, and BMC
%tool).  After that, DSVerifier verification engine performs an (automatic)
%verification of the desired property $\phi$ ({\it i.e.}, stability).  The
%user steps described in Steps $1$--$5$ result in an ANSI-C code that should
%be used as an input for DSVerifier.

Given a plant model in ANSI-C syntax as input (Steps 1--3), \tool constructs
a non-deterministic model to represent the plant family, i.e., it addresses
plant variations as interval sets (Step~A), and formulates a function
(Step~B) using implementation details provided in Steps~$2$ and $3$ to
calculate the controller parameters to be synthesized (Step~C).  Note that
\tool synthesizes the controller for the desired numerical representation
and realization form.  Finally, \tool builds an intermediate ANSI-C code for
the digital system implementation, which is used as input for the CEGIS
engine (Step~D).

This intermediate ANSI-C code model contains a specification $\phi$ for the
property of interest (i.e., robust stability) and is passed to the
Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) module of
CBMC~\cite{ClarkeKL04}, where the controller is marked as the input variable
to synthesize.  CEGIS employs an iterative, counterexample-guided refinement
process.%, which is explained in detail in Section~\ref{synthesizer-general}. 
CEGIS reports a successful synthesis result if it generates a controller
that is safe with respect to~$\phi$.  In particular, the ANSI-C code model
guarantees that a synthesized solution is complete and sound with respect to
the stability property~$\phi$, since it does not depend on system inputs and
outputs.  In the case of stability, the specification~$\phi$ consists of a
number of assumptions on the polynomial coefficients, following Jury's
Criteria, as well as the restrictions on the representation of these
coefficients.% as discussed in detail in Section~\ref{synthesis-elements}.

%\subsubsection{Controller synthesis}

An overview of the algorithm for controller synthesis is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:CEGIS-precision-increment}.  One important observation is that
we verify and synthesize a controller over $k$ time steps.  We~then compute
a completeness threshold $\overline{k}$~\cite{DBLP:conf/vmcai/KroeningS03}
for this controller, and verify correctness for $\overline{k}$ time steps. 
Essentially, $\overline{k}$ is the number of iterations required to
sufficiently unwind the closed-loop state-space system, 
which ensures that the boundaries are not violated for any other $k{>}\overline{k}$.

%\begin{theorem} There exists a finite $\overline{k}$ such that it is
%sufficient to unwind the closed-loop state-space system up to $\overline{k}$
%in order to ensure that $\phi_\mathit{safety}$ holds. 
%\end{theorem}
%
%\begin{proof}
%%
%A stable control system is known to have converging dynamics.  Assume the
%closed-loop matrix eigenvalues are not repeated (which is sensible to do,
%since we select them).  The distance of the trajectory from the reference
%point (origin) decreases over time within subspaces related to real-valued
%eigenvalues; however, this is not the case in general when dealing with
%complex eigenvalues.  Consider the closed-loop matrix that updates the
%states in every discrete time step, and select the eigenvalue $\vartheta$
%with the smallest (non-trivial) imaginary value.  Between every pair of
%consecutive time steps $k\,T_s$ and $(k+1)\,T_s$, the dynamics projected on
%the corresponding eigenspace rotate $\vartheta T_s$ radians.  Thus, taking
%$\overline{k}$ as the ceiling of $\frac{2\pi}{\vartheta T_s}$, after
%$k{\geq}\overline{k}$ steps we have completed a full rotation, which results
%in a point closer to the origin.  The synthesized $\overline{k}$ is the completeness threshold.
%\qed

%\medskip

Next, we describe the different phases in Fig.~\ref{fig:CEGIS-precision-increment}
(blocks 1 to 4) in detail.

%\todo{please eventually itemize next}
\begin{enumerate}

\item The inductive synthesis phase ({\sc synthesize}) uses BMC to
compute a candidate solution $K$ that satisfies both the stability criteria
 and the safety specification.  To synthesize a controller that satisfies the
stability criteria, we require that a computed polynomial
satisfies Jury's criterion~\cite{fadali}.  The details of this calculation can be found in
the Appendix.


Regarding the second requirement, we synthesize a safe controller by
unfolding the transition system $k$ steps and by picking a controller $K$
and a single initial state, such that the states at each step do not violate
the safety criteria.  That is, we ask the bounded model checker if there
exists a $K$ that is safe for at least one $x_0$ in our set of all possible
initial states.  This is sound if the current $k$ is greater than the completeness
threshold.  We~also assume some precision $\langle I_p,F_p\rangle$ for the
plant and a sampling rate.  The checks that these assumptions hold are
performed by subsequent {\sc verify} stages.

\State assert($ \underline{u}  \leq u \leq \overline{u}$)
 \State set $x_0$ to be a vertex state, e.g., $[\underline{x_0},\underline{x_0}]$	
\For {($c=0;~c < 2^\mathit{Num\_States};~c\mbox{++}$)}
  %\State assert($ \underline{x_0}  \leq x_0 \leq \overline{x_0}$)
	\For{($i=0;~i< k;~i\mbox{++}$)}
		%\State $u = (\langle I_p,F_p\rangle)((\langle I_c,F_c\rangle)K * (\langle I_c,F_c\rangle) x)$
		\State $u = (plant\_typet)((controller\_typet)K * (controller\_typet) x)$
		\State $x = A * x + B * u$
		\State assert($\underline{x} \leq x \leq \overline{x}$ )
  	\EndFor
  	\State set $x_0$ to be a new vertex state
  	\EndFor
  %\State Return $K$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Safety check\label{alg:safetycheck}}
\end{algorithm}

\item The first {\sc verify} stage, {\sc safety}, checks that the candidate
solution $K$, which we synthesized to be safe for at least one initial
state, is safe for \emph{all} possible initial states, i.e., does not reach
an unsafe state within $k$ steps where we assume $k$ to be under the
completeness threshold.  After unfolding the transition system corresponding
to the previously synthesized controller $k$ steps, we check that the safety
specification holds for any initial state. This is shown in Alg.~~\ref{alg:safetycheck}.

\item The second {\sc verify} stage, {\sc precision}, 
 restores soundness with respect to the plant's precision
by using interval arithmetic \cite{moore1966interval} to validate the 
operations performed by the previous stage. 

\item The third {\sc verify} stage, {\sc complete}, checks that the current
$k$ is large enough to ensure safety for any $k'{>}k$.  Here, we compute the
completeness threshold $\overline{k}$ for the current candidate controller $K$ and
check that $k{\geq}\overline{k}$.  This is done according to the argument
given above and illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ct}.

\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}


Checking that the safety specification holds for any initial state can be 
computationally expensive if the bounds on the
allowed initial states are large. 


%-------------------------------
\subsubsection{Abstraction-based CEGIS} 
\label{sssec:abstraction}
%-------------------------------


%  The na\"ive approach described in Sec.~\ref{sec:CEGIS-precision-incrementation}
  %uses a multi-staged verification phase and performs solution generalization based on
%the plant precision, the number of loop unrollings, 
  %and the sampling rate. Essentially, it
%  synthesizes a controller for an individual initial state
%and input with a bounded time horizon and, subsequently, it generalizes it to all reachable states,
%inputs, and time horizons during the verification phase.
Essentially, this approach relies on the symbolic
simulation over a bounded time horizon of individual initial states and inputs that form
part of an uncountable space and tries to generalize it for an
infinite space over an infinite time horizon.

%% The verification of a hybrid continuous/discrete system over an

%% Our na\"ive approach
%% creates an abstraction of the system by establishing bounds on the

%% model.  This model is still however, quite complex, hard to verify,
%% and many of the states involved are inconsequential to the safety

Conversely, in this section, 
we  find a controller for a continuous initial set of states and set of inputs, 
  over an abstraction of the continuous dynamics \cite{cattaruzza2015unbounded} that conforms to
  witness proofs at specific times. %% It further generalizes the
  Moreover, this approach uses abstraction refinement enabling us to 
  always start with a very simple description regardless of the complexity of the overall
dynamics, and only expand to more complex models when a solution
cannot be found.

  The CEGIS loop for this approach is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:CEGARIS}.

% Now that we have explained the verification process, we may proceed to describe the synthesis procedure, which is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:CEGARIS}.
% Our model, rather than look at a bisimulation \todo{specific notion that has not been formally define - do not use} in discrete time, explores a much higher abstraction, 
% evaluating the unbounded time-continuous space reach tube as a set of inequalities that represent only the safety specification.
% We have also identified 
% the quantization noise as a bounded non-deterministic input.


\begin{enumerate}
\item 
  We start by doing some preprocessing:%%  that 
  %% can be computationally intensive and we don't want it to be part of the CEGIS loop.

  \begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the characteristic polynomial of the matrix $(A_d-B_dK)$ as 
$P_a(z) = z^n+\sum_{i=1}^n{(a_i-k_i)z^{n-i}}$. 
%\blue{[shouldn't there be a b term in the polynomial's coefficients here? No. the polynomial only evaluates the poles]}

\item Calculate the noise set $N$ from the quantizer resolutions and estimated round-off errors: %($\frac{q_1}{2},\frac{q_2}{2},q_3$)

\end{equation}

%
where  $q_1$ is the error introduced by the truncation in the ADC, $q_2$ is
the error introduced by the DAC and $q_3$ is the maximum truncation and
rounding error in $u_k=-K \cdot \mathcal{F}_{\langle I_c,F_c \rangle}(x_k)$ as
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:numeric_rep}. % More details on how to model
%quantization as noise are given in
%Appendix~\ref{appendix:quantization-noise}.

\item Calculate a set of initial bounds on $K$, $\phi_\mathit{init}^{K}$,
based on the input constraints %\blue{[how is this practically done?With the equation below]}.  
%
$$(\phi_\mathit{init} \wedge \phi_\mathit{input} \wedge u_k=-K x_k)
\Rightarrow \phi_\mathit{init}^{K}$$
Note that these bounds will be used by the {\sc synthesize} phase to reduce the size of the solution space. 

\end{enumerate}
\item In the {\sc synthesize} phase, we synthesize a candidate controller
%We begin with a minimum set of linear inequalities describing the constraints caused by the input and the initial state during a single iteration, in addition to a stability 
% specification defined by Jury's 
%criteria. %, and try to synthesise a controller that meets these specs.
% For a stabilized closed-loop, which is necessary for our safety property, we need
% these roots to remain within the unit circle, which we verify using Jury's criteria.
% Notice that in our polynomials $c_0=1$ and we only use reals.
% Once we have established convergence, we may examine the 
% safety specification $\phi_\mathit{safety}$.
  $K \in \mathbb{R}\langle I_c,F_c\rangle^n$ that satisfies
  $\phi_\mathit{stability} \wedge \phi_\mathit{safety} \wedge \phi_\mathit{init}^{K}$ by invoking a SAT solver.
%%   We obtain it by solving the SAT formula 
%% $$\mathcal{J}_K=\mathcal{J}\langle I,F \rangle (P_{a-k},\mat{T})\wedge \phi_\mathit{safety}$$ 
%% that satisfies the input constraint and Jury's criteria for 
%% $P_{a-k}=z^n+\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i-k_i) z^{n-i} : k_i \in \mat{K} \wedge \tilde{\mat{K}}=\mat{K}\mat{T}$,
%% where $\mathcal{J}\langle I,F \rangle (P,\mat{T})$ is a program describing Jury's method.
If there is no candidate solution we return UNSAT and exit the loop.
\item Once we have a candidate solution, we perform a safety verification % If this step fails, we find a counterexample iteration and initial state and create a new constraint to refine our abstraction.
  %
  of the 
  %consisting of evaluating the
  progression of the system from $\phi_\mathit{init}$ over time,
$x_{k} \models \phi_\mathit{safety}$. %\blue{why $k+1$ here?}. %% For this purpose we require 
%% an initial set $\phi_\mathit{init}= x_0 \in [\underline{x_0} \ \overline{x_0}]$ 
%% from which the system progresses.
% Obviously, this set $x_0$ 
% must satisfy the specification; otherwise, the system will be unsafe to begin with.
% We accept a specification in the form $\mat{E}\mat{T}x_0<\mat{f}$. 
% The presence of $\mat{T}$ is because this will typically be given in the original 
% state-space.
%% Next, we use abstract acceleration to get a second abstraction that 
  %% encompasses the accelerated continuous reach-tube over an unbounded time.
  In order to compute the progression of point $x_0$ at iteration $k$,
  we accelerate the dynamics of the closed-loop system and obtain:
  %we take the
  %the closed-loop model:
  %$x_{k+1}=\mat{A}_{t}x_k+\mat{B}_{n} (\nu_1 + \nu_2 + \nu_3)$
  %and accelerate it to:
%
{
\scriptsize
\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
x=(A_d-B_dK)^kx_0+ \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (A_d-B_dK)^i B_{n}(\nu_1+\nu_2+\nu_3)% 
%\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
B_n= [1 \cdots 1]^T
\end{equation}
}
%\label{eq:acc_observer_LTI_cf}
%+\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \mat{A}_t^i \mat{B}_{t} r_i

%
As this still requires us to verify the system for every $k$ up to infinity,
we use abstract acceleration again to obtain the reach-tube, i.e., the set
of all reachable states at all times given an initial set
$\phi_\mathit{init}$:
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:aa_observer_LTI_cf}
\hat{X}^\#
=\mathcal{A} X_0 + \mathcal{B}_{n} N, \quad
X_0 =\left \{x : x \models \phi_\mathit{init} \right\}, 
\end{align}
%
where $\mathcal{A}=\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty (A_d-B_dK)^k,
\mathcal{B}_{n}=\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty \sum_{i=0}^k(A_d-B_dK)^iB_{n}$ are
abstract matrices for the closed-loop system~\cite{cattaruzza2015unbounded},
whereas the set $N$ is non-deterministically chosen.

We next evaluate $\hat{X}^\# \models \phi_\mathit{safety}$.  If the
verification holds we have a solution, and exit the loop.  Otherwise, we
find a counterexample iteration $k$ and corresponding initial point $x_0$
for which the property does not hold, which we use to locally refine the
abstraction.  When the abstraction cannot be further refined, we provide
them to the {\sc abstract} phase.
%
%\todo{we should have a better argument here.}
%\end{enumerate} 
\item If we reach the {\sc abstract} phase, it means that the candidate solution is not valid,
  in which case we must refine the abstraction used by the synthesizer.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the constraints that invalidate the property
 as a set of counterexamples for the eigenvalues, which we define as $\phi_\Lambda$. This is a constraint in the spectrum i.e., transfer function) of the closed loop dynamics. 
\item We use $\phi_\Lambda$ to
  further constrain the characteristic polynomial %\blue{[again, check the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.]I don't find any error} 
$z^n+\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-k_i)z^{n-i}=\prod_{i=1}^n (z-\lambda_i) : |\lambda_i|<1 \wedge \lambda_i \models \phi_{\Lambda}$. These constraints correspond to specific iterations for which the system may be unsafe.
\item Pass the refined abstraction $\phi(K)$ with the new constraints and the list of iterations $k$ to the {\sc synthesize} phase.

%\subsection{State-space representation of physical systems} 
%\label{ssec:ssrepresentation}
%%-------------------------------
%
%We consider models of physical plants expressed as ordinary differential
%equations (ODEs), which we assume to be controllable and under full state
%information (i.e., we have access to all the model variables):
%%
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:ode}
%\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t)+ B u(t), \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, u \in \mathbb{R}^m, \\ \nonumber A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}, B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}, 
%\end{align}
%%
%where $t \in \mathbb R_0^+$, where $A$ and $B$ are matrices that fully
%specify the continuous plant, and with initial states set as $x(0)$.  While
%ideally we intend to work on the continuous-time plant, in this work
%Eq.~\eqref{eq:ode} is soundly discretized in time~\cite{fadali} into
%%
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:plant}
%x_{k+1} = A_d x_k+ B_d u_k
%\end{align} 
%%
%where $k \in \mathbb N$ and $x_{0}=x(0)$ is the initial state. 
%$A_d$ and $B_d$ denote the matrices that describe the discretized plant dynamics, whereas
%$A$ and $B$ denote the continuous plant dynamics.  
%We synthesize for requirements over this discrete-time domain. 
%Later, we will address the issue of variable quantization, 
%as introduced by the ADC/DAC conversion blocks 
%(\textcolor{red}{we should include a figure that describes the control system model that we tackle}).
%
%
%
%%-------------------------------
%\subsection{Controller synthesis via state feedback}
%\label{ssec:statefeedbackcontrol}
%%-------------------------------
%
%Models \eqref{eq:ode} and \eqref{eq:plant} depend on external non-determinism in the form of input signals $u (t)$ and  $u_k$, respectively. 
%Feedback architectures can be employed to manipulate the properties and behaviors of the continuous process (the plant).   
%We are interested in the synthesis of digital feedback control algorithms, 
%as implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays or Digital Signal Processors. 
%The most basic feedback architecture is the state feedback one, 
%where the control action $u_k$ (notice we work with the discretized signal) is computed by: 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:controlaction}
%u_k = r_{k} - K x_k. 
%\end{equation}
%%
%Here, $K \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a state-feedback gain matrix, 
%and $r_{k}$ is a reference signal (again digital).   
%%
%The closed-loop model then takes the form 
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:closedloopss}
%x_{k+1} = ( A_d - B_d K ) x_k + B_d r_k.
%\end{align}
%%
%The gain matrix $K$ can be set so that the closed-loop discrete dynamics are
%shaped as desired, for instance according to a specific stability goal or
%around a specific dynamical behavior \cite{astrom1997computer}.  As argued
%later in this work, we will target more complex objectives, such as
%quantitative safety requirements, which are not typical in the digital
%control literature.  Further, we will embrace the digital nature of the
%controller, which manipulates quantized signals as discrete quantities represented with finite precision. 
%
%%-------------------------------
%\subsection{Stability of closed-loop systems}
%\label{ssec:stability}
%%-------------------------------
%
%In this work we employ asymptotic stability in the CEGIS loop,  
%as an objective for guessing controllers that are later proven sound over safety requirements.  
%Asymptotic stability is a property that amounts to convergence of the model executions to an equilibrium point, 
%starting from any states in a neighborhood of the point (see Figure~\ref{fig:ct} for the portrait of a stable execution, converging to the origin).  
%In the case of linear systems as in~\eqref{eq:closedloopss}, 
%considered with a zero reference signal, 
%the equilibrium point of interest is the origin. 
%
%A discrete-time LTI system as \eqref{eq:closedloopss} is asymptotically
%stable if all the roots of its characteristic polynomial (i.e., the
%eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix $A_d - B_d K$) are inside the unity
%circle of the complex plane, i.e., their absolute values are strictly less than
%one~\cite{astrom1997computer} (this simple sufficient condition can be generalised, 
%however this is not necessary in our work).  
%In this paper, we express this stability specification $\phi_\mathit{stability}$ in terms of a check known as
%\emph{Jury's criterion}~\cite{fadali}: this is an easy algebraic formula to
%select the entries of matrix $K$ so that the closed-loop dynamics are shaped
%as desired.
%
%%-------------------------------
%\subsection{Safety specifications for dynamical systems}
%\label{ssec:safety}
%%-------------------------------
%
%We are not limited to the synthesis of digital stabilizing controllers -- a
%well known task in the literature on digital control systems -- but target
%safety requirements with an overall approach that is sound and automated. 
%More specifically, we require that the closed-loop system
%\eqref{eq:closedloopss} meets given safety specifications.  A safety
%specification gives raise to a requirement on the states of the model, such
%that the feedback controller (namely the choice of the gains matrix~$K$)
%must ensure that the state never violates the requirement.  Note that a
%stable, closed-loop system is not necessarily a safe system: indeed, the
%state values may leave the safe part of the state space while they converge
%to the equilibrium, which is typical in the case of oscillatory dynamics. 
%In~this work, the safety property is expressed as:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:safetyliteral}
%\phi_\mathit{safety}\iff \forall k\ge 0.\, \bigwedge_{i=1}^{n}{\underline{x_{i}} \leq x_{i,k} \leq \overline{x_{i}}},
%\end{equation}
%where $\underline{x_{i}}$ and $\overline{x_{i}}$ are lower and upper bounds
%for the $i$-th coordinate $x_{i}$ of state $x\in \mathbb R^n$ at the $k$-th
%instant, respectively.  This means that the states will always be within an $n$-dimensional hyper-box.
%
%Furthermore, it is practically relevant to consider the 
%constraints $\phi_\mathit{input}$ on the input
%signal $u_{k}$ and $\phi_\mathit{init}$ on the initial states $x_0$,
%which we assume have given bounds:
%$\phi_\mathit{input} = {\forall k.\underline{u} \leq u_{k} \leq \overline{u}} $, 
%$\phi_\mathit{init} = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} \underline{x_{i,0}} \leq x_{i,0} \leq \overline{x_{i,0}}.$
%For the former, this means that the control input might saturates in view of
%physical constraints.

%
%\textcolor{red}{we should describe here about the performance specifications for dynamical systems.}


%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Numerical representation and soundness} 
\label{sec:numeric_rep}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

\textcolor{red}{Elizabeth: this section needs to be updated to describe about floating-point arithmetic.}

The models we consider have two sources of error that are due to numerical  
representation.  The first is the numerical error introduced by the
fixed-point numbers employed to model the plant, i.e., to represent the
plant dynamics $A_d$, $B_d$ and $x_k$.  The second is the quantization error
introduced by the digital controller, which performs operations on
fixed-point numbers.  In this section we outline the notation for the
fixed-point representation of numbers, and briefly describe the errors
introduced.  A~formal discussion is in
%Appendix~\ref{appendix:numerical_errors}.

Let $\mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F \rangle}(x)$ denote a real number $x$
represented in a fixed point domain, with $I$ bits representing the integer
part and $F$ bits representing the decimal part.  The smallest number that
can be represented in this domain is $c_m=2^{-F}$.  Any mathematical
operations performed at the precision $\mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F \rangle}(x)$
will introduce errors, for which an upper bound can be
given~\cite{DBLP:conf/arith/BrainTRW15}.

We will use $\mathcal{F}_{\langle I_c,F_c \rangle}(x)$ to denote a real
number $x$ represented at the fixed-point precision of the controller, and
$\mathcal{F}_{\langle I_p,F_p \rangle}(x)$ to denote a real number $x$
represented at the fixed-point precision of the plant model ($I_c$ and $F_c$ are determined by the controller. We pick $I_p$ and $F_p$ for our synthesis such that $I_p \geq I_c$ and $\allowbreak F_p \geq F_c$).  Thus any mathematical operations in our modelled
digital controller will be in the range of $\mathcal{F}_{\langle I_c,F_c
\rangle}$, and all other calculations in our model will be carried out in the range of
$\mathcal{F}_{\langle I_p,F_p \rangle}$.  
The physical plant operates in the
reals, which means our verification phase must also account for the numerical error and quantization errors caused by representing the physical plant at the finite precision $\mathcal{F}_{\langle I_p,F_p \rangle}$.


\subsubsection{Effect on safety specification and stability}

Let us first consider the effect of the quantization errors on safety. 
Within the controller, state values are manipulated at low precision,
alongside the vector multiplication $Kx$.
The inputs are computed using the following equation: 
%
\begin{align*}
u_{k}&=-(\mathcal{F}_{\langle I_c,F_c \rangle}(K)\cdot\mathcal{F}_{\langle I_c,F_c \rangle}(x_{k})). 
\end{align*}

This induces two types of the errors detailed above: first, the truncation
error due to representing $x_k$ as $\mathcal{F}{\langle I_c,F_c
\rangle}(x_{k})$; and second, the rounding error introduced by the
multiplication operation.  We represent these errors as non-deterministic
additive noise.

An additional error is due to the representation of the plant dynamics, namely 
%
{\scriptsize
\begin{equation}
x_{k+1} =\mathcal{F}_{\langle I_p,F_p \rangle}(A_d) \mathcal{F}_{\langle I_p,F_p \rangle}(x_{k}) + \mathcal{F}_{\langle I_p,F_p \rangle}(B_d)\mathcal{F}_{\langle I_p,F_p \rangle}(u_{k}).
\end{equation}
}
We address this error by use of interval
arithmetic~\cite{moore1966interval} in the verification phase.

Previous studies~\cite{gangli1} show that the FWL affects the poles and
zeros positions, degrading the closed-loop dynamics, causing steady-state
errors  and
eventually de-stabilizing the system~\cite{Bessa16}.  However, since in this
paper we require stability only as a precursor to safety, it is sufficient
to check that the (perturbed, noisy) model converges to a neighborhood of
the equilibrium within the safe set.

In the following, we shall disregard these steady-state errors (caused by
FWL effects) when stability is ensured by synthesis, and then verify its
safety accounting for the finite-precision errors.

Next, we describe the specific property that we pass to the program
synthesizer as the specification $\sigma$.  There are a number of 
algorithms in our verification engine that can be used for stability analysis~\cite{daes20161, Bessa16}.  
%one based on Schur's decomposition
%and another one based on Jury's criterion~\cite{astrom1997computer}.  
Here we choose Jury's criterion~\cite{astrom1997computer} in view of its efficiency 
and ease of integration within \tool: 
we employ this method to check the stability in the $z$-domain for the
characteristic polynomial $S(z)$.

%% between the char. poly. $S(z)$ and the later quantities $\Delta
%% N_{G}(z), \Delta D_{G}(z)$ and corresponding controller's
%% structure.]}.
%
We~consider the following form for $S(z)$:
%
\begin{equation*}
S(z) = a_0z^N+a_1z^{N-1}+\cdots+a_{N-1}z+a_N=0, a_0\neq0. 
\end{equation*}
%\cdsay{is this for the matrix $\left( \begin{array}{c} Y \\ U \end{array}\right)$?}

% Assuming that $\hat{G}(z) = \frac{\hat{N_G}(z)}{\hat{D_G}(z)}$
% and $\hat{C}(z) = \frac{\hat{N_C}(z)}{\hat{D_C}(z)}$, then:
% $$S(z) = FWL[N_C(z)] \times \hat{N_G}(z) + FWL[D_C(z)] \times \hat{D_G}(z)$$
Next, the following matrix
$M = [m_{ij}]_{(2N-2)\times N}$ is built from $S(z)$ coefficients:

%
$$
v_{ij}^{(0)}=\left\{

\end{array}
\right.
$$
%
and where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ is such that $0 < k < N - 2$. 
We have that~\cite{astrom1997computer} 
$S(z)$ is the
characteristic polynomial of a stable system if and only if the following four conditions hold:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 
$R_1: S(1) > 0$;
%\item 
$R_2: (−1)^N S(−1) > 0$;
%\item 
$R_3: |a_0| < a_N$;
%\item 
$R_4: m_{11} > 0 \wedge\allowbreak
      m_{31}>0 \wedge\allowbreak
      m_{51}>0 \wedge \ldots \wedge\allowbreak
      m_{(2N{-}3)(1)}>0$.
%\end{itemize}
%
The stability property is then encoded by a constraint of the form:
$
\phi_\mathit{stability} \equiv (R_1 \wedge R_2 \wedge R_3 \wedge R_4).

\subsection{Formal specification of safety} 
\label{ssec:safespecification}
%-------------------------------

We are not limited to the synthesis of digital stabilizing controllers -- a
well known task in the literature on digital control systems -- but target
safety requirements with an overall approach that is sound and automated. 
More specifically, we require that the closed-loop system
 meets given safety specifications.  A safety
specification gives raise to a requirement on the states of the model, such
that the feedback controller (namely the choice of the gains matrix~$K$)
must ensure that the state never violates the requirement.  Note that a
stable, closed-loop system is not necessarily a safe system: indeed, the
state values may leave the safe part of the state space while they converge
to the equilibrium, which is typical in the case of oscillatory dynamics. 
%However, a safe system will always be stable.  
In~this work, the safety property is expressed as:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:safetyliteral}
\phi_\mathit{safety}\iff \forall k\ge 0.\, \bigwedge_{i=1}^{n}{\underline{x_{i}} \leq x_{i,k} \leq \overline{x_{i}}},
\end{equation}
%
%\addtodo{We consider $x_{i}^{-}$ and $x_{i}^{+}$ to be -1 and 1, respectively.}
%
where $\underline{x_{i}}$ and $\overline{x_{i}}$ are lower and upper bounds
for the $i$-th coordinate $x_{i}$ of state $x\in \mathbb R^n$ at the $k$-th
instant, respectively.  This means that the states will always be within an $n$-dimensional hyper-box.

Furthermore, it is practically relevant to consider the 
constraints $\phi_\mathit{input}$ on the input
signal $u_{k}$ and $\phi_\mathit{init}$ on the initial states $x_0$,
which we assume have given bounds:
$\phi_\mathit{input} = {\forall k.\underline{u} \leq u_{k} \leq \overline{u}} $, 
$\phi_\mathit{init} = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} \underline{x_{i,0}} \leq x_{i,0} \leq \overline{x_{i,0}}.$
For the former, this means that the control input might saturates in view of
physical constraints.

%-------------------------------
\subsection{Formal specification of transient response} 
\label{ssec:transientspecification}
%-------------------------------

In a SISO system, there are 2 values that typically define the response-time of the system (using a step response).
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{rise time} is defined as the time it takes the output to reach a percentage (eg $90\%$) of the target value given a step chnage in the input.
\item The \emph{settling time} is defined as the time it takes the output to stabilize within a margin of the target value (eg $10\%$).
\end{enumerate} 
In the case of first and second order systems (with ), the decay is governed by the equations 
\begin{align*}
&y_{decay}=
&\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
e^{-|\omega| t}& 1^{st} order\\
e^{\zeta |\omega| t}\left(\frac{\sin\left(|\omega| t\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}+\sin^{-1}\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}\right)}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}} \right)&\zeta<1\\
e^{-|\omega| t}-|\omega| t e^{-|\omega| t}&\zeta=1\\
\frac{|\omega| e^{-|\omega_2| t}-|\omega_2| e^{-|\omega| t}}{|\omega|-|\omega_2|}&\zeta>1\end{array}\right.
\end{align*}
where $|\omega|$ and $|\omega_2|$ are the magnitudes of the eigenvalues (roots) of the system and  $\zeta=-\cos(\theta)$ where $\theta$ is the polar angle of the conjugate pair if it exists ($\zeta \geq 1$ if it doesn't).
These equations become increasingly complicated for higher order systems. However, we note their strong dependency on the magnitude of the eigenvalues, and use this property to define an upperbound on the decay function.
All of the above equations will decay faster than $e^{-|\omega| t}$ given $|\omega| < |\omega_2|$, hence we may use this function as our upper bound.
\begin{theorem}
Given a set of eigenvalues for a discrete time modle of an $n^{th}$ order system $\lambda_i =e^{\omega_i}: i \in [1\ n]$, the settling time of the system is upperbounded by
\begin{equation}
t_s<-log_{|\overline{\lambda}|}({p_s}) : |\overline{\lambda}| =\max(|\lambda_i|) \wedge |\overline{\lambda}|<1,\ \forall i \in [1\ n]
\label{eq:set_time}
\end{equation}
where $0\leq p_s \leq 1$ is the desired percentage of the target within to remain after $t_s$.
\end{theorem} 
\begin{proof}
Given a closed loop single output LTI system of order $n$ with dynamics
\begin{equation}
\left\{\begin{array}{c}\vec{x}_k=\mat{A}\vec{x}_{k-1}\\ \vec{y}_k=\mat{C}\vec{x}_k\end{array}\right. \Rightarrow \left\{ \begin{array}{c}\vec{x}_k'=\mat{J}\vec{x}_{k-1}'\\ \vec{y}_k=\mat{C}\mat{S}\vec{x}_k'\end{array}\right. : \left\{ \begin{array}{c}\mat{A}=\mat{S}\mat{J}\mat{S}^{-1} \\ \vec{x}_k'=\mat{S}^{-1}\vec{x}_k\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
the output decay is a linear combination of the decay of eigenvalues or eigenvalue pairs. Hence the overall decay of the system is always smaller than $p=e^{-|\overline{\omega}| t}$ where $0\leq p\leq 1$ is the remaining percentage of the decay expressed. reversing we have $t=-\frac{ln(p)}{|\overline{\omega}|}=-\frac{ln(p)}{ln(|\overline{\lambda}|)}$. replacing for $p_s$ , $t_s$, and $\overline{\lambda}$ we get equation \eqref{eq:set_time}
\qed
\end{proof}
We may now use this limit to express a constraint in terms of the coefficients for our synthesis process.
Let 
\begin{equation}
P=\prod_{i=0}^n (s-\lambda_i)=\sum_{j=0}^n c_js^j.
\end{equation}
We use Jury's criterion to limit $|\lambda_i| \leq 1$. Let us now define a transformation $\lambda_i'=\frac{\lambda_i}{\overline{\lambda}}$. We want to ensure $\lambda_i' \leq 1$ which can be done by applying Jury's criterion to $P'=\prod_{i=0}^n (s-\lambda_i')=\sum_{j=0}^n c_j's^j$ where $c_j'$ are unknown. However, if we replace for $\lambda_i$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
P'=\prod_{i=0}^n (s-\lambda_i')=\prod_{i=0}^n (s-\lambda_i\overline{\lambda})=\sum_{j=0}^n c_j\overline{\lambda}^{n-j}s^j
\end{equation}
where all members are known, we may now synthesise coefficients that ensure the eigenvalues are smaller than a desired magnitue, thus ensuring that the settling time is too.

%\section{Stability of Closed-loop Models}
%\label{sec:appendix-stability}
%%-------------------------------
%
%%-------------------------------
%\subsection{Stability of closed-loop models with fixed-point controller error}
%\label{sec:stab_FWL}
%%-------------------------------
%
%The proof of Jury's criterion~\cite{fadali} relies on the fact that the relationship between states and
%next states is defined by $x_{k+1} = (A_d - B_dK) x_k$, all computed
%at infinite precision.  When we employ a FWL digital controller, the
%operation becomes:
%%
%\begin{align*}
%x_{k+1} &= A_d \cdot x_{k} -(\mathcal{F}_{\langle I_c,F_c \rangle}(K)\cdot\mathcal{F}_{\langle I_c,F_c \rangle}(x_{k})).  \\
%x_{k+1} &= (A_d  - B_dK) \cdot x_k + B_dK\delta, 
%\end{align*}
%%
%where $\delta$ is the maximum error that can be introduced by the FWL
%controller in one step, i.e., by reading the states values once and
%multiplying by $K$ once.  We derive the closed form expression for $x_n$ as
%follows:
%%
%\begin{align*}
%x_{1} &= (A_d  - B_dK)x_0 + B_dK\delta \\
%x_{2} 
% &=(A_d  - B_dK)^2x_0 + (A_d  - B_dK)B_dK\delta + B_dK\delta \\
%x_{n} &= (A_d  - B_dK)^nx_0 + (A_d  - B_dK)^{n-1}B_dK\delta + ... \\  \nonumber & + (A_d  - B_dK)^1B_dK \delta + B_dK\delta \\
%  &= (A_d - B_dK)^nx_0 + \sum_{i=0}^{i=n-1}(A_d - B_dK)^iB_dk\delta. 
%\end{align*}
%
%The definition of asymptotic stability is that the system converges to a
%reference signal, in this case we use no reference signal so an
%asymptotically stable system will converge to the origin.  We know that the
%original system with an infinite-precision controller is stable, because we
%have synthesized it to meet Jury's criterion.  Hence, $(A_d - B_dK)^n x_0$ 
%must converge to zero.
%
%The power series of matrices
%converges~\cite{horn1990matrix} iff the eigenvalues of the matrix are less
%than~1 as follows:
%%
%%\begin{align*}
%$\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}T^i  = (I - T)^{-1}$, 
%%\end{align*}
%%
%where $I$ is the identity matrix and $T$ is a square matrix. Thus, our system will converge to the value 
%%
%\begin{align*}
%0 + (I - A_d + B_dK)^{-1}B_dk\delta \,. 
%\end{align*}
%%
%As a result, if the value $(I - A_d + B_dK)^{-1}B_dk\delta$ is within the
%safe space, then the synthesized fixed-point controller results in a safe
%closed-loop model.  The convergence to a finite value, however, will not
%make it asymptomatically stable.

%\section{Errors in LTI models} \label{sec:appendix:LTIbackground}
%%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%
%\subsection{Errors due to numerical representation} \label{appendix:numerical_errors}
%
%We have  used $\mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F \rangle}(x)$ denote a real number
%$x$ represented in a fixed point domain, with $I$ bits representing the
%integer part and $F$ bits representing the decimal part.  The smallest
%number that can be represented in this domain is $c_m=2^{-F}$.  The
%following approximation errors will arise in mathematical operations and
%representation:
%%
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item {\bf Truncation:} Let $x$ be a real number, and $\mathcal{F}_{\langle
%I,F \rangle}(x)$ be the same number represented in a fixed-point domain as
%above.  Then $\mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F \rangle}(x) = x-\delta_T$ where the
%error $ \delta_T=x\ \%_{c_m}\ \tilde x$, and $\%_{c_m}$ is the modulus
%operation performed on the last bit. 
%Thus, $\delta_T$ is the truncation error and it will propagate across
%operations.
%%
%\item {\bf Rounding:} The following errors appear in basic operations.  Let
%$c_1, c_2$ and $c_3$ be real numbers, and $\delta_{T1}$ and $\delta_{T2}$ be
%the truncation errors caused by representing $c_1$ and $c_2$ in the
%fixed-point domain as above.
%%
%\begin{enumerate}
%%
%\item Addition/Subtraction: these operations only propagate errors coming
%from truncation of the operands, namely $\mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F
%\rangle}(c_1) \pm \mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F \rangle}(c_2) = c_3 + \delta_3$
%with $|\delta_3| \leq |\delta_{T1}| + |\delta_{T2}|$.
%%
%\item Multiplication: $\mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F \rangle}(c_1) \cdot
%\mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F \rangle}(c_2) =  c_3 + \delta_3$ with $|\delta_3|
%\leq |\delta_{T1}\cdot\mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F \rangle}(c_2)|\allowbreak +
%|\delta_{T2}\cdot\mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F \rangle}(c_1)| + c_m$, where
%$c_m=2^{-F}$ as above.
%%
%\item Division: the operations performed by our controllers in the FWL
%domain do not include division.  However, we do use division in computations
%at the precision of the plant.  Here the error depends on whether the
%divisor is greater or smaller than the dividend:  $\mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F
%\rangle}(c_1) / \mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F \rangle}(c_2) = c_3 + \delta_{T3}$
%where $\delta_{T3}$ is $(\delta_{T2}\cdot c_1 - \delta_{T1}\cdot
%c_2)/(\delta_{T2}^2 - \delta_{T2} c_2)$,
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\item {\bf Overflow:}
%The maximum size of a real number $x$ that can be represented in a fixed
%point domain as $\mathcal{F}_{\langle I,F \rangle}(x)$ is $\pm
%(2^{I-1}+1-2^{-F})$.  Numbers outside this range cannot be represented by
%the domain.  We check that overflow does not occur.
%
%\end{enumerate}
%
%%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%\subsection{Modeling quantization as noise} \label{appendix:quantization-noise}
%%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%
%During any given ADC conversion, the continuous signal will be sampled in
%the real domain and transformed by $\mathcal{F}\langle I_{c},F_{c} \rangle
%(x)$ (assuming the ADC discretization is the same as the digital
%implementation).  This sampling uses a threshold which is defined by the
%less significant bit ($q_{c}=c_{m_c}=2^{-F_c}$) 
%of the ADC and some non-linearities of the circuitry.  The overall conversion is
%%
%$$\mathcal{F}\langle I_{c},F_{c} \rangle(y(t)) = y_k :
%y_k \in \left[y(t)-\frac{q_{c}}{2}\ \ \ \ y(t)+\frac{q_{c}}{2}\right] \,.$$
%%
%If we denote the error in the conversion by $\nu_k=y_k-y(t)$ where $t = nk$,
%and $n$ is the sampling time and $k$ the number of steps, then we may define
%some bounds for it $\nu_k \in [-\frac{q_{c}}{2}\ \ \frac{q_{c}}{2}]$.
%
%We will assume, for the purposes of this analysis, that the domain of the
%ADC is that of the digital controller (i.e, the quantizer includes any
%digital gain added in the code).  The process of quantization in the DAC is
%similar except that it is calculating $\mathcal{F}\langle I_{dac},F_{dac}
%\rangle (\mathcal{F}\langle I_{c},F_{c} \rangle (x)) $.  If these domains
%are the same ($I_{c}=I_{dac},\allowbreak F_{c}=F_{dac}$), or if the DAC
%resolution in higher than the ADCs, then the DAC quantization error is equal
%to zero.  From the above equations we can now define the ADC and DAC
%quantization noises ${\nu_1}_k \in [-\frac{q_1}{2}\ \ \frac{q_1}{2}]$ and
%${\nu_2}_k \in [-\frac{q_2}{2}\ \ \frac{q_2}{2}]$, where $q_1=q_{c}$ and 
%$q_2=q_\mathit{dac}$.  This is illustrated in
%Fig.~\ref{ssec:statefeedbackcontrol} where $Q_1$ is the quantizer of the ADC
%and $Q_2$ the quantizer for the DAC.  These bounds hold irrespective of
%whether the noise is correlated, hence we may use them to over-approximate
%the noise effect on the state space progression over time.  The
%resulting dynamics are
%%
%\begin{align*}
%%\label{eq:pre_quantization}
%{x}_{k+1} = {A}_d{x}_k+{B}_d({u}_k+{{\nu}_2}_k), \quad u_k = -K{x}_{k}+{{\nu}_1}_k, 
%\end{align*}
%%
%which result in the following closed-loop dynamics:
%%
%\begin{align*}
%%\label{eq:quantization}
%{x}_{k+1} &= ({A}_d-{B}_d{K}_d) {x}_k+{B}_d{{\nu}_2}_k +{{\nu}_1}_k \,.
