The ss_models.mat file contains 5 state-space systems: 

(1) DC motor, 
(2) plane pitch, 
(3) Buck converter, 
(4) Boost converter, 
(5) Buck-Boost Converter.

(1) and (2) were extracted from http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?aux=Home
(3), (4), and (5) were extracted from the paper entitled as "DC-DC Converter Modeling and Simulation using State Space Approach" by Rodney H.G. Tan and Landon Y. H. Hoo.

We should use the input range of [-10,10] in SS systems (3), (4) and (5);  [-1,1] in SS system (2); and [-500,500] in SS system (1).
